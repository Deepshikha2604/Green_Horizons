Our team of four developed a website named "Green Horizons" under the topic of sustainable development, aimed at promoting both human and environmental health. This project was a collaborative effort where each team member brought unique skills and perspectives to create a comprehensive and user-friendly platform. "Green Horizons" provides tools for users to track their health metrics and environmental impact, making it a unique site for holistic well-being.

One of the key features of the website is the Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) calculator. This tool helps users understand their daily caloric needs based on personal information such as age, weight, height, and activity level. By providing this information, users are empowered to make informed decisions about their nutrition and fitness, which is crucial for maintaining a healthy lifestyle.

In addition to the BMR calculator, "Green Horizons" features a Carbon Footprint calculator. This tool allows users to assess their environmental impact by analyzing their daily activities and lifestyle choices. By highlighting areas where users can reduce their carbon emissions, the Carbon Footprint calculator encourages the adoption of more sustainable habits, contributing to the overall goal of environmental conservation.

The website also includes fundamental pages such as Home, which introduces the site's mission and features; About Us, which provides background information on the project's creators and goals; and a Feedback Form, allowing users to share their experiences and suggestions. These pages are designed to enhance user engagement and provide comprehensive information on sustainable living practices.

Through these features, "Green Horizons" aims to create an informative and interactive platform that supports sustainable living and holistic health. Our team is committed to making a positive impact on both individual health and the environment, and we believe that "Green Horizons" is a step in the right direction towards achieving this goal.
